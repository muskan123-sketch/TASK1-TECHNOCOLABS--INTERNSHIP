Data Cleaning means the process of identifying the incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant or missing part of the data and then modifying, replacing or deleting them according to the necessity. Data cleaning is considered a foundational element of the basic data science. Data is the most valuable thing for Analytics and Machine learning. In computing or Business data is needed everywhere. When it comes to the real world data, it is not improbable that data may contain incomplete, inconsistent or missing values. If the data is corrupted then it may hinder the process or provide inaccurate results.
